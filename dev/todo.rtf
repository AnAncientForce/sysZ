[sysZ / To do]

Present issues:

- Better thread handling or an alternative approach needs to be used so there are no tk errors

Solved issues:

- picom-animations-git no longer exists so it has been replaced, it works fine one one laptop but very slow on the other

* replaced with picom-simpleanims-git

To do

- create python config so user can select if they want animations or not [DONE]

- attempt to merge most features from shell scripts into python [50/50]

- Add a "Do not notify me about updates" check box in control panel [DONE]

- Put sysZ .json config in the home/config folder so it dose not get updated with the repo. This is a much better idea [DONE]

- Make tk interface look more polished/nicer [IN_PROGRESS]

* hard because on MacOS, everything just looks better by default
* centered the main_frame depending on window size upon first 0.1 secs from launch

- Replace progress bar with loading wheel [DONE]

* is now thread based, meaning the loading/waiting times are dependant on how long the shell scripts take to execute
* warning: non-crashing tk issues occuring

- Code clean up, remove old comments [IN_PROGRESS]
