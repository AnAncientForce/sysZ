    Open a terminal and run these commands in order

    sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils

    lsmod | grep btusb

    sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
    sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service

    bluetoothctl

    power on
    agent on
    default-agent
    scan on
    devices

    pair DC:F4:CA:CB:93:A1
    trust DC:F4:CA:CB:93:A1
    * Replace the code with your own device's code

    Troubleshooting:
    1. to set as default output, check the "tick" box next to the device in pavucontrol
    2. if the device is already paired and not connecting, use the remove command and re-pair.

    Ensure "blueman" is installed

        sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
        sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
