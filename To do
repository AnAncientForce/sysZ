Possible issues

- picom-animations-git no longer exists so it has been replaced, it works fine one one laptop but very slow on the other

To do

- create python config so user can select if they want animations or not [DONE]

- attempt to merge most features from shell scripts into python [50/50]

- Add a "Do not notify me about updates" check box in control panel [DONE]

- Put sysZ .json config in the home/config folder so it dose not get updated with the repo. This is a much better idea [DONE]

it works
